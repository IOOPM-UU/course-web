* Getting in Touch
- Talk to us during lectures and labs :: 
     See the [[https://cloud.timeedit.net/uu/web/schema/ri1875ZQ0QYZ01Q0wo7YwcQ25y6QZ6XfYxZ020g.html][schedule]] for details. 
- Use [[https://piazza.com/class/jkd32onglxi2vb][Piazza]] :: 
     For questions that are not sensitive, consdier asking a [[public][public question]] (/Entire Class/)
     rather than a [[private][private question]] (/Individual Student(s) / Instructor(s)/). Most questions are of interest to many students,
     and often, many other students chip in to try and untangle some issue, 
     which is good for everyone.
- Come by our offices :: 
     Tobias is not in most Tuesdays, but otherwise he should be around unless he is not lecturing or labbing on IOOPM. 
- Send us an email ::
     This should be the last resort, really. Please use your student email so that we
     have an easier time knowing who we are talking to. 
- NEVER call or text :: 
     Really, don't do that!

** How do I ask a public question on Piazza? <<public>>
1. Start by searching the Piazza site using the search dialogue at top left. If the question has already been answered, you’re done. If the answer is not quite what you’re looking for, use the "follow up discussions" below the existing question to create a follow up.
2. If the above is not successful, use the search feature on this page (check the menu). 
3. If the above is not successful, time to use Piazza!
   Create a new question by pressing the “New Post” button at top right.
   You should post to "Entire class" unless there is a strong reason to make your question private.
   You may make your post anonymous, but only do so if you are particularly uncomfortable revealing your identity. 

** How do I ask a private question on Piazza? <<private>>

Follow the steps above for a public question, but select
"Individual Student(s) / Instructor(s)", rather than "Entire
class". Type the name of the person you want to contact. Tutors
names are listed here.

* Practical Matters
** Salary and scheduling
- Salary is paid by the month, irrespective of the number of hours worked in that period
- We manage the assignment of TAs to labs through a Google spreadsheet
  - *Aim:* At least 5 TAs per lab/not counting me or Gustaf
  - 100h students = 80h labs, bookable at 40 x 2 h slots + coaching (we will get to that)
  - 50h students = 46h labs, bookable at 23 x 2 h slots 
- Course schedule 
  - Labs twice a week (typically Mondays and Thursdays)
  - Group meetings 6 times per semester 
* Being a TA
- You are now *employed* by the university
- When acting in your TA role, that means you will be representing the university
  - That essentially means acting *professionally*
  - Being examiner for people that you know/like/dislike/dislike you/etc. 
  - Being able to separate on/off work
  - Approaching a diverse student population with an open mindset, *and visibly so*
  - You are now at the forefront of what defines people's study environment! 
  - Make sure you are not taking a power trip 
- My worst experience on this course: "Go back to SFI"
* Why are YOU here? 
- We have interacted with you and the past, and we know you are great! 
- You've all passed through IOOPM and been recognised for your (various) abilities
- We spend a lot of effort each year through the course, looking for good TA material 
- In addition to your knowledge and skills, you bring some star quality
  - You are good at explaining things
  - You are good at expressing yourselves
  - You don't complicate matters unnecessarily
  - You bring a lot of good energy 
  - You are "good people"
* What we expect of you
1. To be able to act professionally (as discussed above)
2. To help us get as many people as possible to realise their true potential during the course
   - Be an obstacle, not a springboard
3. To help Tobias be connected to as many students/schools of thought/etc. as possible 
** The IOOPM Contract
#+BEGIN_VERSE
If /you/ do your best to get the most out of the course, 
/we/  will do our best to make sure you pass the course 
with the highest possible grade
#+END_VERSE
This requires (of teachers, TAs, and students)
- Trust
- Flexibility
- Open dialogue
*** Realising their true potential 
- Not all students start at the same level 
- We are not aiming for them to finish at the same level
- We are looking for the maximal development for each student
- And there is a *lower bar* (the passing grade)
*** Past students think
- They never worked so hard for credits
- They never leard as much for the same credits 
- They realise their capacity to accomplish things 
- IOOPM is the course when they grok programming 
*** Listning to students
- Running a course is not a popularity contest -- we are not doing this so that people like us
- However, we need to be sensitive to negative group think...
- ...and to the fact that we are sometimes wrong
- We get lots of love for changing things mid-air (so we like to keep doing that)
*** Creating a movement
- Essentially, we want to create a 
* Diversity
- There are a lot of different students 
  - Gender
  - Background
  - What they want out of the course
  - What they want out of their education 
- Different groups of students need/do/say/think different things
  - There is manual for this
  - Be sensible and use your head at all times! 
- Watch out for bad things -- and *address immediately*
  - Weak students getting lousy tasks that don't teach them stuff
  - "Boys clubs"/grabbighet
  - Offensive comments and treatments 
  - The nice person getting a lighter treatment
  - Härskartekniker

** Protocol for addressing bad stuff
- If it makes sense -- put your foot down then and there
- Regardless, inform me (orally and in writing)

* Examining demonstrations in the labs
- You are not performing -- the students are 
- You cannot possibly be expected to know everything 
  - There are always students that know more than me
  - However, I have a title that makes me bullet-proof
- What to do if you are challenged in some way 
- How to avoid being challenged 
- Where to go for help/backup/support/high-fives
* Examining demonstrations
- Expectations (2 post-its, 2 minutes) 
- Biggest fears (2 post-its, 2 minutes)
- Dealing with a diverse student population 
  - Examining students of a different gender
- Help people as much as possible but never give "solution without understanding"
