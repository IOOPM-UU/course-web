#+title: Instructions for Publishing to the Course Web

* Manually 

1. Open Emacs and load =index.org= -- this loads and evaluates =publish.el= (needs confirmation for security reasons)
2. Run =M-x org-publish= and type =ioopm website= (autocomplete works). This should load everything onto the website. 

* TODO Automated

* Changes for each year
- In =publish.el=, change the target website to the right url
