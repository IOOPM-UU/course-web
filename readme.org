#+title: Instructions for Publishing to the Course Web

* Publish all changed pages

1. Open Emacs and load =index.org= -- this loads and evaluates =publish.el= (needs confirmation for security reasons)
2. Run =M-x org-publish= and type =ioopm website= (autocomplete works). This should load everything onto the website. 

To publish the current buffer, use =M-x org-publish-current-file=. 

* Changes for each year
- Each year's webpage should have a unique URL so that old students can see the old information.
- Starting in 2018, let =/ioopm= point to the current page. 
- In =publish.el=, change the target website to the right url.

* Backlog
** Prune repeated information (seems consistent /now/ but will complicate updates)
