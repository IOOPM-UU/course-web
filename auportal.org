* Introduction to the AU Portal Software

A normal year, we take close to 2000 oral demonstrations during
this course. Every student's progress needs to be tracked as
roughly 50--70 achievements, etc. You can imagine the complexity.

Being technology-oriented people, we naturally come to the
conclusion that we need software to help coordinate all of this so
that our time can be spent interacting with you rather than with
the clerical tasks of tracking your progress. In the pandemic year
of 2020, if we can shave of 2-3 minutes for each demonstration on
finding the bleeping zoom link, that will not just go a long way
towards protecting our sanity, but with 2000 demonstrations (plus
help requests!), that's like having one more TA on the course. 

Later in the course, we'll talk about how this software is built,
as a case study in the course. Not because it is the greatest
thing, but because it is something you can relate to, and maybe
even want to improve to scratch some itch you've been having. 

At the time the course starts, the AU portal allows you to do the
following:

1. During labs (technically 24/7) -- put a help request in a queue
   that is being served by TA's who will connect to you with Zoom
   and Cloud 9
2. Similar to help requests, you can put in a request to
   demonstrate that you master some of the achivements on the
   course. 
3. You can get an overview over what have accomplished, what you
   have still to do, and if you are on track to finish the course
   on time.

** Accessing the AU Portal

To access the AU portal, you will need your normal CAS login that
you use to access most of UU's services, like say Studentportalen.
Just click on the CAS link. 



** First-Time Set-Up

The first time you login to the AU portal, you will be taken
through a setup wizard that wants your:

1. Profile picture
2. Your initial target grade (feel free to leave this at 3 from the start)
3. Your [[./zoom.org::number][Zoom number]]

Once you are done with that, we also want your [[Link to GitHub][Link to GitHub]]. 

The profile picture is used by the teachers on this course in two ways:

1. It helps us recall who you are (most people are bad at names
   but good with faces) when we see your name in the list of requests
2. It helps us with legal certainty-aspects of examination: before
   you are allowed to demonstrate, we will ask you to show us your 
   ID and compare that to your profile picture, so that we can be
   reasonably certain you are who you claim to be :) 


*** Who can see whose profile picture?

1. You can see your own picture, but not those of other students
2. You can see the profile picture of all teachers 
3. All teachers can see the profile pictures of all students

*** Target Grade?

The target grade is the grade you want to show in the burndown
chart. It also filters the achievements shown in the TODO list.
The number is saved in the database -- this is necesary for us to
support some filtering and remember your settings between
sessions. Teachers do not have access in the system to specific
students' target grades.

You can change this settting as often as you like.

*** Enable Notifications

When you load the page for the first time, it will (depending on
your browser) ask to be allowed to display notifications. This is
of course optional, but we hope you will allow them to reduce the
chance of missing that a TA is waiting to help you, etc.

** Requesting Help

To request help, click on the help request button on the side menu
to get to the help request page. In the middle, you will see the
queue of help request tickets , which are typically being served
in FIFO order, modulo circumstances.

When you request help, please list the people who are asking for
help together -- typically you and your pair programming partner.
You are also able to write a short message. This is optional. It
may be good for getting the attention of a specific teacher, or
put a link to a Piazza thread, or something else. 

You will also note there is a Zoom button. This button links to
the Zoom room of the person making the request, and it is in the
Zoom room of this person that help will be given. 

The TAs collaborate on claiming the tickets. When your ticket has
been claimed, you will be notified -- in the browser if you have
opted out of system notification. When you see the notification,
we expect you to -- if you have not done so already -- immediately
go into Zoom so that you are there when help arrives. 

Because of TA's being so few (in relative terms), their time is
valuable so please help us making sure it does not go to waste!

When you are all done, the TA will click on the done button to
remove the ticket from the queue. We take internal measurements of
the time it takes from submitting a request to having it claimed
and marked done. We use these for our internal quality control. 

You can of course cancel a help request if you feel like it. You
are not allowed to be listed in more than one help request at a
time.

** Requesting a Demonstration

Requesting a demonstration is very similar to requesting help.
List the partner you will be demonstrating with. Pick the
achievements you want to demonstrate. 

Read more about the non-technical aspects of demonstrations [[./about.org::* Redovisning och AU-Portalen][here]].

** Exploring Your Progress 

In the dashboard, we show the number of achievements remaining to
finish the course with the current target grade, some information
about your current and average velocity, and the target grade. The
burndown visualises this. We also show the achievements remaining
in a list, which is clickable such that it takes you to the
descriptions of the achievements.

** Code Space

In the code space tab (computer icon) we have collected all your
login information to set up and access Cloud 9. Click on the
computer icon and then the pink button to get information about
how to setup.


** Link to GitHub

The first time you click the GitHub icon, the AU portal will
request to read the public information from your GitHub account.
You will need to allow this to continue. The only information that
we want is the name of your GitHub account. Once you have allowed
us to access this name, we send an invite to you to join the
IOOPM-UU organisation on GitHub and link your account to the
private repository where you are required to host your code during
this course.

These steps are all automated, and may take up to a 1 minute to
complete. Move the mouse over the GitHub icon to see when the help
text changes from "link to GitHub" to a name of your GitHub repo
(=first.last.1234=). Once that is done, you can click the link and
get to your repo.


* Join the Fun!

Most of this code has been contributed by people working pro bono
-- because it is fun to develop things and provide services to
others. We will try to provide some starter bugs and low hanging
fruits to get going. 

Once the new system is stable enough, the code will be made public
on GitHub here: https://github.com/IOOPM-UU/auportal2020/


* Living With Shaky Software

The new AU Portal is an infant. 
It will contain bugs. 
It will go down. 
It will do stupid things. 

What it will not do is lose data. And even if it does, that is
frequently backed up and moved away from the server elsewhere. 


* TODO Technological Choices

** TODO Frontend: React

** TODO Backend: Spring
