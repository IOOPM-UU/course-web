* About This page
This page gathers all the achievements on the course for your
perusal. Read about what each achievement corresponds here. Some
are marked *TODO*, meaning they are being somewhat reworked
for 2018. When they are finalised, the *TODO* marker will
disappear.

You will use the [[http://auportal.herokuapp.com][AUPortal]] to select goals for demonstration and
track your own progress. Starting in 2018, the AUPortal points
back to this page for information about each achievement. I am
testing gathering all achievement on a *single page* to facilitate
searching -- I'm eager to get feedback on this design choice. An
alternative would be to gather all Abstraction achievements on one
page, all Inheritance achievements, on another etc.

Each achievement is /tagged/ to reflect its grade level and
demonstration form -- mirroring information in the AU Portal:
