*Nerd fact:* These pages are generated using [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], 
a modified [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][ReadTheOrg]] template, and a bunch of scripts. 

*Ended up here randomly?* These are the pages for a one-semester
course at 67% speed on imperative and object-oriented programming
at the [[http://it.uu.se][department of Information Technology]] at [[http://www.uu.se][Uppsala University]],
created by [[http://wrigstad.com][Tobias Wrigstad]].
